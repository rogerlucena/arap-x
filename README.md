# Surface modeling and intuitive deformations

Three.js based 3D mesh deformation sandbox.

App available at: https://arap-x.herokuapp.com

## As-Rigid-As-Possible paper implementation

The model deformations are calculated following the algorithm detailed in [1] below.

This project was developed for the *INF555 - Digital Representations and Analysis of Shapes* course at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. 

## How build/run locally
To easily build and run the sandbox locally just run the following commands in the root:

```
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

The generated docker image is heroku ready!
